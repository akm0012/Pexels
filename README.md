# Pexels

Pexels is a 100% Kotlin Android App that uses the [Pexels API](https://www.pexels.com/api/) to search for images.  

It showcases some advanced Android topics including: 
- Coroutines / Flow
- Room Database
- Jetpack Navigation Components 
- Jetpack Work Manager 
- MVVM Architecture 
- Offline First
  - Try repeating some past searches with your WiFi off  
- A home grown "Pinch To Zoom" custom ImageView (Dust off your Algebra textbooks...)
- Fragment Transitions with Shared Elements (with some help from [this](https://medium.com/@serbelga/shared-elements-in-android-navigation-architecture-component-bc5e7922ecdf) article)
